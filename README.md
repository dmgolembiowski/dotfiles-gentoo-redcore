# dotfiles-gentoo-redcore
My big tower, "sparky", runs Redcore Linux with these dotfiles

# TL;DR
I've used i3, bspwm, hyprland, and other desktop window tiiling frameworks, but in terms of the best X11 experience I can find, KDE is still the best imo.
With the right key-bindings, autostart programs, custom shortcuts, and customizations, there really isn't anything you can't do with KDE.
